MadLib, console creates a story with different inputs
Peer Review: Jessie Lamzon
Code is working well and runs without any errors.  I like how simple and well formated the code looks!  Good job!

Open up the code then press F5, then it will open the localhost, copy the local host and put it into postman. after that type in the controller name, the route, and the input.
